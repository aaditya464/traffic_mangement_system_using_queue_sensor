Traffic Mangement using queue sensor
This project is embedded project. Please first see the diagram file and then program_density file.
This project is made as a prototype for a 2 way road system, using 6 IR sensors and 2 timers which control the traffic light with 8951 microcontroller. Ultrasonic sensors can replace the IR sensors, as per requirement.
